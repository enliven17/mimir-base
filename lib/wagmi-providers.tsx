/**
 * App-level wallet providers.
 *
 * Two ways in, deliberately: **Privy** for anyone who does not already hold a
 * wallet (email or social, with an embedded wallet created for them), and **Base
 * Account** for anyone who does — the only connector that can batch approve(USDC)
 * and the stake into a single confirmation.
 *
 * Privy drives wagmi through its own WagmiProvider, so `useAccount`, `useConnect`
 * and every existing hook keep working whichever door the user came through.
 *
 * ConnectKit and RainbowKit both peer with wagmi 2.x and would have forced a
 * downgrade that costs the Base Account connector. Privy peers with wagmi >=2 and
 * pins the exact viem this repo already runs, which is why it is here at all.
