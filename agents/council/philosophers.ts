/**
 * The Philosopher Council — a second jury track alongside the existing personas.
 *
 * Adapted from the Council of High Intelligence
 * (https://github.com/0xNyk/council-of-high-intelligence, MIT © 2026 nyk).
 * That project's personas are deliberation agents for open-ended questions; here
 * each one is narrowed into a **claim adjudicator**: given the same evidence and
 * settlement rule, it must return a verdict and say what would change its mind.
 *
 * The point is NOT stylistic flavour or manufactured disagreement. Each
 * philosopher applies a genuinely different epistemic or normative frame to the
 * SAME evidence, so their spread is informative rather than decorative:
 *
 *   socrates    does the settlement rule even mean one thing?
 *   ada         can the rule be mechanically evaluated as written?
 *   feynman     rebuild the outcome from the raw observations
 *   kahneman    what is the reference class, and which bias is loudest?
 *   taleb       bounded or fat-tailed domain, and what is the exposure?
 *   munger      invert — what would guarantee the other verdict?
 *   machiavelli who benefits from the source saying this?
 *   meadows     what feedback loop actually produced this outcome?
 *   aurelius    separate what the evidence settles from what it does not
 *   lao-tzu     is abstaining the honest answer?
 *
 * The last two matter more than they look: a jury with no principled route to
 * "unresolvable" will manufacture confidence on genuinely ambiguous claims.
