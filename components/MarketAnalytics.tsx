 * Renders nothing; exists only to hold the market funnel hooks.
 *
 * The VS page returns early while loading and when a claim is missing, so the
 * hooks cannot live in that component — they would be called conditionally and
 * React would throw "rendered more hooks than during the previous render" on the
 * transition from loading to loaded. Inside a child that mounts only in the
 * loaded branch, the same hooks are unconditional.
